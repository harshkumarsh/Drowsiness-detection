# Drowsiness-detection
DROWSINESS DETECTION SYSTEM

Overview:
---------
This Drowsiness Detection System is designed to monitor drivers for signs of drowsiness and alert them to take necessary actions to prevent accidents. The system uses a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect early signs of fatigue and drowsiness in real-time.

Features:
---------
- Real-Time Detection: Continuously monitors the driverâ€™s face and eyes to detect signs of drowsiness.
- Eye Blink Detection: Measures the blink rate and duration to determine the level of alertness.
- Yawning Detection: Detects yawns by analyzing mouth movements.
- Alarm System: Alerts the driver with an audible alarm if drowsiness is detected.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for easy use.

Technologies Used:
------------------
- OpenCV: For real-time video processing and facial feature detection.
- Dlib: For accurate facial landmark detection.
- Machine Learning: Classifiers to determine drowsiness levels based on eye and mouth movements.
- Python: Core programming language for implementing the system.
